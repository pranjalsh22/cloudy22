## Overview

Cloudy Output Interpreter is an open-source web application for analyzing outputs from the astrophysical photoionization code CLOUDY.

The application:

- Extracts final converged emergent emission-line spectra from CLOUDY output files  
- Performs wavelength standardization and captures convergence warnings  
- Provides [O III] and other emission-line diagnostics  
- Generates interactive emission-line catalogues with filtering and plotting  
- Converts CLOUDY continua into luminosity density  
- Computes bolometric and band-limited luminosities (IR, optical, UV, X-ray)  
- Produces physically annotated spectral energy distribution (SED) plots  

This tool is officially listed in the CLOUDY Contributed Materials repository maintained by Dr. Gary Ferland.
